# Motivation:
The motivation behind this project from real-life incidents that highlight the critical need for effective power management systems.

In 2012, a tragic incident occurred at a wood mill in Burns Lake, Canada, where two employees lost their lives and twenty others were injured in a fire and explosion caused by overloading. This incident served as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences that can arise from poor power management.

Similarly, in 2009, a building near Jama-cloth experienced a devastating fire due to overloading, resulting in significant losses for the entire wholesale market. These incidents, though seemingly small at first, have the potential to escalate into large-scale disasters, with lives being lost due to the lack of an adequate power management system.

To address these pressing concerns, this project aims to develop and implement an efficient power management system that can prevent such incidents and ensure the safety and well-being of individuals and businesses. By incorporating advanced monitoring, control, and protection mechanisms, we strive to create a robust system that can effectively manage power loads and prevent overloading scenarios.
Through the deployment of this solution, we aim to mitigate the risks associated with poor power management, promote safety, and protect valuable assets. Our goal is to provide a reliable and comprehensive power management system that can be implemented across various industries, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents and ensuring a safer working environment for everyone.
