# Abstract:
As we know that the power quality crisis within installations has gained significance since the 1980s. The interest in power quality is related to all three participants involved in the power system: utility companies, equipment manufacturers, and electricity consumers. Problems affecting the electricity supply that were once considered tolerable by utilities and users are now commonly recognized as issues impacting the operation of common equipment.

In response to rising prices in the power industry, efforts have been focused on finding ways to regulate or modify the electricity consumption during specific hours of the day.
The purpose is to reduce power-related damages in industries through power factor compensation using shunt capacitors. This project leads to a reduction in the electrical bills for industries and commercial areas. In this project, I have my electrical Distribution Pannel (DB), and has wireless display.

The electrical device transfers power to the meter and then to the Low Tension (LT) room. The power generated in the LT area is then distributed to other rooms through the distribution area. The setup also includes an LCD panel for load flow analysis. Additionally, a wireless load flow module is installed in the Electrical Supervisor area to provide real-time information about crucial electrical values.
