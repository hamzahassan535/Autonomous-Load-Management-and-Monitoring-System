# METHODOLOGY:
The methodology employed for this project involved several key steps to address the power management system challenges. Initially, we conducted comprehensive research and analysis on existing power management systems to gain insights into their functionality, behavior, and cost implications. This literature review phase provided valuable information on previous power management systems, including their limitations and shortcomings.

Based on the identified issues, we proposed a solution to address these challenges. One major concern was the low power factor leading to excessive power consumption and increased utility bills. To overcome this, we designed an automated power management system. This system incorporated capacitor banks to improve power factor and store surplus power. By ensuring equal load distribution to each area, we aimed to reduce utility bills and enhance the reliability of the power supply.

In the first phase of the project, we successfully implemented and tested the automated power management system in our department.

Our plan was to incorporate Ethernet technology to wirelessly display load flow analysis for each area on a smart alphanumeric display. This will be achieved using Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling us to monitor load flow from anywhere using smartphones or computers. We conducted thorough testing and analysis of our Autonomous Load Management and Monitoring System project to ensure its effectiveness.
