# Specific Objectives Being Addressed by the Project:
This project aims to address specific objectives related to cost-effective and efficient power management and saving systems using IoT and wireless display.

One of the primary objectives is to improve the overall power quality in industries, especially those with variable load conditions and significant inductive loads. This project proposes the implementation of automatic capacitor banks to enhance power factor, stabilize voltage levels at the load, and reduce electricity bills. Additionally, these capacitor banks can effectively handle the reactive power requirements during light-load periods, minimizing energy wastage and preventing overvoltage.

This project also emphasizes the importance of appropriate installation and careful study when deploying capacitor banks. Improper installation without sufficient analysis can lead to various technical issues. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the long-term requirements and considerations associated with capacitor banks is crucial for their successful implementation.

To achieve the objectives, the project utilizes an electricity meter, generator, and wireless display through IoT integration. The electricity generated is transferred to the meter and subsequently to the Low Tension (LT) Room. From the LT Room, the electricity is then distributed to other rooms through the distribution area. An LCD panel is incorporated for load flow analysis, providing real-time monitoring and evaluation of electrical values. Moreover, a wireless load flow module is installed in the Electrical Supervisor area to keep the supervisor informed about critical electrical parameters.
